TITLE :  Calgary Catholic Immigration Society

DESCRIPTION: 

Calgary Catholic Immigration Society is a non-profit organization which provides settlement and integration services to all immigrants and refugees in Southern Alberta.

We are a community leader with over 35 years of solid experience in the design and delivery of comprehensive resettlement and integration services to refugees and immigrants. We pride ourselves in delivering these services through a dynamic multicultural, multilingual and multidisciplinary team of professionals, who collectively speak over 60 languages. This diversity enables us to provide our clients and the community with optimum assistance. We have over 1,500 volunteers who devote their time to helping newcomers.

We offer a wide variety of specialized services that were designed to aid and enhance the integration process.

Experience the world without leaving Calgary. Volunteer with immigrant and refugee families today!

Are you interested in interacting with people from different cultures? Do you want to make a difference in newcomers’ lives by supporting their transition to Calgary? Volunteers provide practical and social support to new immigrants and refugees, helping them to learn about Canadian culture, navigate transportation, health-care systems, find resources, practice English, and feel less isolated through participation in social activities. 

Each volunteer or group of volunteers is connected with an individual or family based on the volunteer’s preferences and the client’s needs. Factors to be considered include: volunteer’s skills, background, hobbies, and location in Calgary. Volunteers are expected to visit their assigned families once a week (for 1-4 hours), for 6 months to 1 year, in order to develop a trusting and supportive relationship.

All applicants are subjected to a screening process, and training will be provided on cross-cultural interaction, settlement processes, and practical mentorship support. Ongoing supervision, guidance, and professional development opportunities will be provided.

The Community Connections for Newcomers Program (CCN) is part of the comprehensive support CCIS provides to new immigrants.

If you have any questions or would like to apply, please contact Marcella Ducasses at 403 262 2013 or mducasses@ccisab.ca.

4:13 Therapeutic Riding Association aims to relieve conditions associated with disability by providing therapeutic riding programs to support the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of individuals of all abilities and their families. Our organization provides individualized, accessible, and affordable programs for children of all abilities. To do so, we rely on the generous support of volunteers to assist our instructors during lessons and work with our horses before and after lessons. Each lesson is typically one hour in length with up to four riders. Volunteers help with grooming and tacking, leading horses in lessons, walking alongside students, and fundraising. 

During lessons, a sidewalker’s primary responsibility is to ensure the safety of the rider. The degree of assistance will depend on the balance and ability of the rider. Sidewalkers also assist the instructor by keeping the rider focused on tasks, explaining instructions, physically assisting the rider when necessary, encouraging, socializing, and correcting balance and body position as needed.

A leader's primary responsibility is to ensure that the horse is controlled at all times for the rider's safety. The degree of assistance will depend on the rider and horse. We encourage riders to engage independently to the best of their ability with the leader assisting when required. Volunteers are also able to help with grooming and tacking horses before lessons and untacking horses after lessons.

ABOUT Downstage Performance Society
Downstage is a professional theatre company that produces Canadian plays which create meaningful conversation around social issues. Our work provokes vibrant dialogue between Calgarians both informally and through our nightly post-show discussions. With a focus on new work created by local artists, we offer artistic experiences that are entertaining, inventive, thought-provoking and highly relevant to your everyday life. 

Our plays have tackled topics as diverse as queer identity & bullying, homelessness, and anxiety among youth, while the work of the resident Downstage Creation Ensemble has explored questions of ocean health (In the Wake), personal debt (Bust) and the relationship between oil & gas and agriculture in Alberta (Good Fences). Our plays have received critical acclaim and awards, including five Betty Mitchell Awards and two Calgary Critics’ Awards in recent years. We are also a Resident Company of Arts Commons, curating the Motel Theatre as an affordable venue for a range of smaller companies and emerging artists. 

We’re working hard to make our shows accessible to a wide range of Calgarians - whether that’s by touring our creation work to community halls around the city and province (like the Downstage Creation Ensemble’s "Good Fences"), doing a free run of a play that’s livestreamed online ("rihannaboi95" by Jordan Tannahill) or offering tickets at no cost through our Pay-It-Forward program

About Cornerstone Youth Centre: 
Cornerstone Youth Centre first opened its doors in 1994, and is a grassroots, non-profit, non-denominational charitable organization, designed to teach life skills and "The 40 Developmental Assets" in order to best inspire and prepare youth for a successful life. Everything we do is intended to "fill the toolbelts" of youth, so they may have the tools to handle life's tricky situations before they are forced to deal with them. Prevention is our game.

We serve youth grades 6-9 in the northeast and southeast quadrants of Calgary. Each year we increase our enrollment, and each year we are excited to see our centres grow. 

Our youth centres have a fully stocked Music Studio, Daily Art/Crafts, Basketball Court, Kitchen, Pool Table, Foosball, Computers, Tutoring, Mentorship and more.

We believe in ensuring there are no barriers for access of service, and don’t charge membership fees or costs for any program or field trip.
